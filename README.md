  pubCrawl: Fantasy Tavern Generator

## Sub-Heading ##
  Randomly generate a tavern for your D&D 5e campaign, complete with detailed patrons and bar menu!

## Summary ##
  Select a tavern size (small, medium, large), quality (squalid, average, opulent), and theme (human, dwarven, elven) and see it instantly populated with patrons! Each patron will include unique stats in accordance with the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rule books.

## Problem ##
  Are you tired of plotting out an extremely nuanced campaign story arc, complete with exciting twists and dramatic cut scenes, only to have your players prefer spending all of their time carousing the local bar scene, leaving you unprepared? Do you loathe spending hours cooking up a flavourful tavern in the hopes that maybe* your adventurers will want to check out its every detail?

## Solution ##
  Worry no more! pubCrawl will let you spin up a tavern full of campaign potential in just seconds!

## Customer Quote ##
  "Why are you like this? Why won't you just go outside and talk to girls like your brother? This is not healthy behaviour for an adult male. Where did we go wrong?"
  -Mary Ellison, Sean's mom
